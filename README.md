# Telegram Bot for the card game Secret Hitler

*(This repository is **a Persian‑language fork** of the original project.  It adds single‑player debug mode, RTL fixes, and Farsi defaults while keeping full compatibility with upstream.  The original English README is preserved below for convenience.)*

This is a simple Telegram Bot for the political (and in my opinion highly entertaining and educational) card game [Secret Hitler](http://secrethitler.com/).
Go check out this awesome game and support the creators!

## Start a game

You can contact the bot via [t.me/SecretHitlerFaBot](https://t.me/SecretHitlerFaBot) or in Telegram under the name @SecretHitlerFaBot.
Click Start and add the bot to your group (you need 5-10 people). The rest should be self explanatory.
If you have any problems or find a bug please open an issue here on GitHub!

```

## Test new features

The bot above is not necessarily running the latest code of this GitHub repo. To test new features you can use [@sechit\_testbot](https://t.me/sechit_testbot). After some test games and a few weeks the latest code is also deployed to the main bot.
